# Weekly-Uplift-Monday-Email-Reminders
This Python script automates sending Monday motivation emails via Gmail. It reads motivational quotes from "quotes.txt" and sends a random quote to the sender's own email address. The script securely logs in to Gmail using provided credentials, and the email is sent with a subject "Monday Motivation" followed by the selected quote.
